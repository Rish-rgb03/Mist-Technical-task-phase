 picoCTF — "Caesar Decryption"

Challenge :  recover the hidden flag from a doubly-encoded string

---

Summary

A single input was provided which turned out to be two layers of Base64 encoding followed by a Caesar cipher. By decoding the Base64 layers and brute-forcing the Caesar shift (26 possibilities), we recovered a readable flag.

Final flag`picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_f0212758}`

```

 Step-by-step Solution

 1) Inspect the Input

The string ends with `==`, which is a common indicator of **Base64** encoding. All characters belong to the Base64 alphabet (`A–Z`, `a–z`, `0–9`, `+`, `/`, `=`), confirming our suspicion.

 2) Decode Base64 (Layer 1)

Decoding once reveals another Base64-encoded string enclosed within quotes:

```
b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX20wMjEyNzU4fQ=='
```

This means we need to decode it again.

 3) Decode Base64 (Layer 2)

After decoding the second layer, we obtain the following string:

```
wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_m0212758}
```

The format `{}` indicates a CTF-style flag, but the text inside is not yet readable. This hints at a **Caesar cipher**.

 4) Identify the Caesar Cipher

A Caesar cipher shifts letters by a fixed number between 1 and 25. By testing all possible shifts, we eventually find that a shift of **19** produces readable text:

```
caesar_d3cr9pt3d_f0212758
```

 5) Decode the Prefix

Applying the same shift of 19 to the prefix `wpjvJAM` yields:

```
picoCTF
```

Combining both parts, we get:

```
picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_f0212758}
```

Analysis

Why Base64?

CTF challenges often use multiple encoding layers to mislead solvers. Base64 is easy to identify due to its limited character set and padding (`=` signs). Always check for these signs when starting a challenge.

 Why Caesar Cipher?

Once text is decoded and still looks scrambled but alphabetic, a simple substitution cipher like Caesar is a logical next step. It’s one of the oldest and easiest classical ciphers to break — only 26 possible shifts exist.

About `f0212758`

The numeric portion `f0212758` is likely an identifier or random sequence appended for uniqueness. Decoding it via Base64 yields unreadable binary, meaning it is not another encoded message.

| -----------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base64 Encoding | Recognizable by `=` padding and limited character set. Often appears in CTFs.             |
| Caesar Cipher    | A simple letter-shift cipher with 26 possible keys. Easily brute-forced.                  |
| Shift Detection  | If you can guess one plaintext letter, you can compute the shift mathematically.          |
| Layered Encoding | Challenges often nest multiple encodings; decode until text looks structured or readable. |


 Conclusion

This challenge demonstrated a common CTF pattern: Base64 → Base64 → Caesar Cipher. Through systematic decoding, we successfully retrieved the final flag:

Flag: 'picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_f0212758}'
